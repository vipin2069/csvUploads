#CSV Upload

-	Upload any csv file into the system (consider the delimiter to be a comma ‘ , ’) [If you don’t know what’s a csv, download the other file in this folder and take a look at it, then google a little more]
-	Display a list of all uploaded csv files
-	When the user selects a file, display all the data (with column headers) in a table on the page (front end)
-	There should be a search box which searches on the front end itself and displays the matching rows of the table only (empty search box displays all the data). (you can put a search on any one column)
-	DIFFERENT CSV FILES WITH DIFFERENT COLUMN HEADERS CAN BE UPLOADED, YOUR TABLE HEADERS SHOULD BE DYNAMIC
-	Sorting button (ascending and descending) for each column on the front end
-	Put a validation on the front end and server side on being able to upload only csv type of files
-	Pagination of the data displayed in the table to a max of 100 records per page
